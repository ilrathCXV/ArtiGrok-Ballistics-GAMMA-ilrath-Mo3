	<string id="ammo_357_fmj_head_descr">
		<text>This anomalous modifaction of the .357 Monolithic FMJ has the unique ability to penetrate all types of armor and all forms of bullet resistance when striking a target's head or a mutant's vitals. However, if the round does not hit either of those areas, the round's unique properties will be nullifed, leaving you with a round whose performance is akin to that of rusty ammo.</text>
