	</string>
	<string id="ammo_20x70_devastator_glass_descr">

		<text>20x70 Lightning slugs (AP+)</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ammo_20x70_star_lightning_descr">
		<text>Zone-made slugs made with fragments of various electric-based artefacts. This anomalous round reacts chaotically with critical hit points and armored targets. When coming into contact with such areas, it summons a lightning strike, damaging both the target hit initially and anyone nearby. The lightning strike's power and area-of-effect increases the more heavily armored a target is or the tougher a mutant is. However, this summoned lightning strike will not damage the user.</text>
