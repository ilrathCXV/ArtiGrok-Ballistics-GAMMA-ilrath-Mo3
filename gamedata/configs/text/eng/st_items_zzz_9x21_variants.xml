	</string>
	<string id="ammo_9x21_sp10_bad_descr">

		<text>Experimental pistol cartridge utilizing an electric-based powder load. This round sacrifices some stopping power in exchange for an anomalous effect.

	</string>
	<string id="ammo_9x21_sp12_bad_descr">
		<text>"Homemade" variant of the standad SP12 rounds. Despite this cartridge's low penetration to body armor, it boasts devastating power to mutants and unprotected Stalkers. Due to the round not being tied to any specifications, the round fragments on impact which deals massive damage to any unprotected body parts. Great for mutant hunting or taking out lightly-armored thugs.</text>
