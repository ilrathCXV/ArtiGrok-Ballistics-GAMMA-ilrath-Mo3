	<string id="ammo_new_23_eco_descr">
		<text>Special use cartridge developed by the Ecologists, part of an ongoing joint study with Duty. This cartridge contains a hollow metal ball filled with a liquid toxin derived from chemical anomalies. On impact with a target, the toxin vaporizes into a chemical cloud that severely weakens the targets and produces a similar effect on any nearby targets. Against all targets it induces lethargy and weakness, making them more susceptible to impacts and other forms of damage, and it reduces the strength of their attacks. Specially ordered by Duty to increase the chances of surviving highly dangerous mutant raids by weakening the stronger monsters or killing small mutants with a single shot from this cartridge.</text>
