		<text>A small artefact formed by thermal anomalies in the Zone under extreme temperatures. The look suggests that it was an organ of a vascular plant. Further studies showed that other organic tissues are fused deep inside. The stem doesn't hold any useful properties. On the contrary, the small pins reduce the temperature of the user's body and cools all objects in their vicinity. This artefact offers slight psy-protection as it will resonate under the influence of psy-waves. On the other hand, it is not recommended to approach chemical and acid anomalies when in possession of the artefact as it will increase the adverse effects of acids and toxins in the user's bloodstream.\n \n

This artefact is also highly sought after by jewelers outside the Zone as its inner core is not radioactive and considered to be of exceptional beauty if polished and refined. Only the first 1cm of its outer layer emits radiation. It is, however, highly advised to proceed with caution when planning to bring the artefact to the market as prolonged exposure to even minimal amounts of radioactive materials can result in the death of the user.

Due to its beautiful inner core, it is highly sought after by jewellers all over the world, however it is best to proceed with caution as unskilled treatment can cause the artefact to explode with power sufficient to level a small building. It is thus highly advised to perform the polishing by means of specialized machinery which minimizes the probability of an explosion. Only the outer core of the artefact emits radiation. Nightstar will also absorb toxic and chemical agents from the environment, making it a valuable artefact for artefact hunters, even though the amount of toxicity absorbed is negligible. It is, however, relatively cheap and even stalkers with pretty tight budgets can afford it. That being said, Nightstar emits odour of burning flesh when in the closest proximity of heat source. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite.\n \n

Death Lamp was first discovered a few years ago by a group of three experienced stalkers. Shortly after delivering the artefact to the Ecologists in Yantar, two of them were found dead with a horrific expression on their face. Nothing is known about the fate of the third stalker. Following the accident, members of the science team who studied the artefact had reported having nightmare disorder in the days to follow.
