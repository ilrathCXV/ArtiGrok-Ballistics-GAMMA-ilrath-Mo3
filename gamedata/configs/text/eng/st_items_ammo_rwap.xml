		<text>The .300 Blackout (7.62x35mm) AP cartridge loaded with an 8.4 gram armor-piercing bullet, composed of a steel penetrator tip over a copper alloy core with a copper semi-jacket in a brass case. Despite the bullet's own characteristics when used in a full-power cartridge, these are affected when transferred to an intermediate cartridge, however, the bullet continues to have capabilities to pierce basic and intermediate body ballistic protections, in addition to being able to cause substantial adverse effects on the target after impact. Its design also allows it to be used in STANAG 5.56x45mm NATO magazines without any issues.</text>

Thanks to its rudimentary design, this cartridge is one of the most economical options of its caliber, and despite this, the bullet in this cartridge has capabilities to pierce basic ballistic body protection, as well as certain intermediate models in addition to provide a considerable stopping power effect, however, it has a significant bounce probability on various surfaces. Its design also allows it to be used in STANAG 5.56x45mm NATO magazines without any problem.</text>
