All affected targets will become more susceptible to all future damage it may take on. Additionally, they will have their strength and/or equipment impaired, severely reducing any damage they may inflict on others. However, this round is made for crowd control and does very little damage to targets themselves.

		<text>Experimental 9x39mm round created by the Mercenaries. This round's design improves its performance, doing more damage to targets that are relaxed. When fired with a suppressed weapon, the effect still applies to all targets. The force from this round is also strong enough to rattle an enemy do the bone, causing them to unintentionally unload their weapon and forcing them to reload ammo back into it.</text>

		<text>Experimental 9x39mm round created by the Monolith. Making use of artefact fragments in the powder load, the round is able to make enemies near the inital struck target expereince some of the pain felt by said target. Rounds that strike the head or vital areas will cause even more pain to be felt. Along with its damage-sharing properties, targets that are unaware of the shooter, or if the shooter is using a suppressed weapon, causes the round to much more damage that expected. These rounds were created to not only dispatch enemies of the Monolith, but to scare any future attacks on it with stories of people "dying from an invisible force".</text>

		<text>High-precision variant of the 7.62x54mm round, with a flat nose that provides tight groupings at medium to long ranges. These rounds are used for competition shooting where accuracy and precision are key, and thus these rounds are all carefully built to be exactly the same. The flat nosed round is designed for superior weight distribution and to punch clean holes through targets, and is tipped with a plastic plug to retain maximal aerodynamic performance. While the armor penetrating capabilities are lacking, the sheer force of impact due to the flat nose is enough to cause deadly concussions. In practice, snipers report that headshots with these rounds will lethally concuss targets, almost always guaranteeing a kill. Proper use of such rounds demands high skill.</text>

While seemingly counterintuitive, these rounds are used to great effect by members of Duty to provide a huge amount of short-range firepower in taking down mutant hordes, acting as a sort of heavy automatic shotgun. Due to the round's short range, there is no reason to fire this out of a rifle.</text>

On contact with a target, electrical energy is transferred. This round's true power is shown on heavily armored targets, powered armor, or striking mutants in their weak points: a lightning strike is called down upon the target, dealing damage to it and all other targets nearby. The lightning's strength grows proportionally to the armor of the target, or the hardiness of the mutant.</text>
