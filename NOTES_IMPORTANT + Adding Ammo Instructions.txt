Ballistics rework, merging elements of GBOOBS and ArtiBalls with new options, streamlined crafting, and new effects and effect reworks!
Started as a collaborative effort between Mo3 and ilrathCXV, fully headed by ilrathCXV with the help of other modders such as Andtheherois and etapomom.

This is currently in the BETA stage. The merge is complete and incorporated into Grok's Ballistics, while taking advantage of Arti's conversion of bad ammo to special ammo types plus some special ammo effects.

ilrathCXV - 6/30/2024 - This document is not fully up-to-date with Version 2.0.0. It is missing documentation on mutant_/gigant_/stalker_mod stats.
This will be done at a later date. Sorry for the inconvience.

Instructions for implementing new ammo/modifying ammo into ArtiGrok (written by ilrathCXV):
First, go into this mod's files and go to the directory: [this mod]\gamedata\configs\ammo
Next, either create a new .ltx (ammo_(custom_name_here).ltx without the parenthesis) or add it to the "ammo_extras_modded.ltx" file included with this mod.

We will now look at an example of an ammo type that will give you a good look at how these file entries should be structured.

Example of an ammo type that has nearly all the elements involoved in the system - 5.56x45 FMJ Bad (now bridge b/w regular FMJ and AP)

[ammo_5.56x45_fmj_bad]:ammo_5.56x45_fmj 		-- This is the debug name of the ammo. The ":ammo_5.56x45_fmj" just means it is inheriting some stats from the standard FMJ ammo. For custom ammo, I suggest using ":ammo_base"
handler     = arti_handlers.fragment_sound		-- This is a handler from Arti's system. Due to changes, the "handler" is no longer needed.
name		= ammo_new_5.56x45_fmjs				-- This is the name designation of the ammo. Pull the designation from the file the ammo is found (vanilla ammo: "weapons_ammo.ltx" / BaS ammo: w_ammo_bas.ltx"). Custom ammo will be found in that mod's files.
k_hit		= 1.1 								-- This is the "k_hit" parameter of the ammo. This isn't used by the system anymore as of Update 7. This value is pulled straight from the file the ammo is found in.
k_ap		= 0.326								-- This is the "k_ap" parameter of the ammo. It has been modified from Arti's system to give players a look at the BR/AP tier an ammo type has in Grok's BR/AP system. Pull the value from ammo's file (changes in here do not change actual parameter in calculations; change it via DLTX if you want to change it).
cost        = 2250								-- This is the "cost" parameter of the ammo. It was used by Arti's system to modify the cost of ammo. Pull the value from ammo's file or change it if the ammo is old ammo you are looking to change  (changes in here only take effect is the "Cost" option in this mod's MCM settings are turned on).
dg_ammo     = ammo_5.56x45_fmj					-- This parameter takes in another ammo that this ammo can degrade/convert to when looting (in order to offset the fact bad-now-special ammo is more prevalent). Only necessary if you want to make use of this.
dg_chance   = 0.5								-- This parameter is the chance that this ammo will degrade/convert into the ammo in the above line. This MUST be used in combo with the above line if you choose to use this conversion system.
frag        = 1.6								-- Special: EXPLAINED LATER
special     = frag								-- Special: EXPLAINED LATER

There is are extra parameters not shown above that directly affect damage number: "stalker_mod", "mutant_mod", and "gigant_mod"

stalker_mod	= ...								-- Multiplier to damage done to all Stalkers. Mainly used as a way to buff damage for the ammo in a way that will not reflect on damage done TO THE PLAYER.
mutant_mod	= ...								-- Multiplier to damage done to all mutants.
gigant_mod	= ...								-- Multiplier to damage done to pseudogiants. If not present, "mutant_mod" will be used instead. Have this be the same or greater than "mutant_mod".

Now, to explain Special effects. I will show the Special effects, explain what they do and how to in corporate them into your ammo.

Varmaggedon - This Special type increases damage against mutants and Zombified Stalkers (Sin not included) by 60%.
Recommended range for use with HP/hunting rounds.

special     = varma								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to see if the ammo is of this type


Dragon's Breath - Self-explanatory. This allows the ammo to act like Dragon's Breath. Changes hit type to Fire and applies 5 "Burn" stacks for each hit. Maximum "Burn" stacks applied depends on the amount of pellets/projectiles the bullet has.
Recommended ONLY for shotguns.

"Burn" stacks are applied on hit, with targets receiving 3x the normal "Burn" stacks on a headshot/hitting a critical hitbox with this ammo type.
Every second, an enemy takes Fire/Burn damage equal to the number of "Burn" stacks they have. If no new "Burn" stacks are applied to a target within 5 seconds of the last application, all "Burn" stacks on the target will disappear.
If a target dies with 20 or more "Burn" stacks, they will "Ignite", spreading their "Burn" stacks evenly among an hostile targets within 8 meters of them.

special     = fire_melt							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects


Acid Rounds - These rounds increases the amount of armor you take away from Stalkers. For mutants, it ignores special mutant damage resistance and effectively do 75% increased damage. It changes the damage type to Chemical burn.
These rounds tend to have medium-level AP power at base but low-stopping power, but receives plenty of AP bonuses from its own effect. Acid Rounds break Stalker armor by an additional 5 AP points, then the total armor lost is then multiplied by 75%.
When a target is hit by any type of round with the "Acid" effect 3 times, the target "splashes" Acid on itself and hostile target within 8 meters of themselves, which applies the "Armorbuster" effect on those affected (see "Armorbuster Rounds" for more details).
Recommended on small-caliber ammo types, with low base damage. Utility/debuffing ammo type.

special 	= acid										-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects
i_handler   = ballistic_handlers.particle				-- Used by Arti's system to call the particle function
i_particle  = artefact\\effects\\af_acidic_idle_color 	-- The particle effect used by the function called by the line above


Armorbuster Rounds - These rounds increases the amount of armor you take away from Stalkers. For mutants, it ignores special mutant damage resistance and effectively do 30% increased damage. It changes the damage type to Chemical burn.
These rounds tend to have medium-level AP power at base, but receives bonuses from its own effect. Armorbuster Rounds break Stalker armor by an additional 1 AP point, then the total armor lost is then multiplied by 30%.
Targets who are debuffed by the "Acid Rounds" splash effect will always suffer from the Armorbuster effect. This stacks with the armor-defeating buffs of "Acid Rounds", but a splash-debuffed enemy will not have Armorbuster rounds stack as they use the same effect.

special		= armorbuster								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects


"Shock" Rounds - These rounds do normal bullet damage and are barely better than their normal counterparts, but apply "Shock" stacks to targets on hit. Targets hit in the head or a critical area will receive 3x the amount of "Shock" stacks when hit.
When a target reaches 20 or more Shock stacks, they will release a weak Lightning AoE, damaging itself and targets caught in the radius (see Lightning Rounds for more details). They will then lose 20 "Shock" stacks, meaning they can cause another Lightning AoE if they reach 20 or more "Shock" stacks again.
Recommended for small-caliber rounds or small-rifle FMJ variants.

special		 = shock 								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects (not to be confused with Dragon's Breath's "fire_melt" Special tag)
shock_stacks = 3									-- Amount of "Shock" stacks applied on hit. Increased by 3x upon landing headshots or hitting critical areas.


Lightning Rounds - This ammo creates an AoE damaging field when striking a target. The AoE's damage and size is based on the amount of armor value present on the impacted area. The AoE radius has a minimum range of 2-12 meters randomly, with the armor value adding to said value.
If the hit area has at least 30 armor value, it will cause the Lightning AoE. If a critical area or the head of a target is struck, it will always create a Lightning AoE. "Shock" AoEs will always do a weaker AoE, regardless of the armor on the target. 
Changes the damage type to Shock damage.
Enemies who are hit by 3 seperate Lightning AoEs (from Lightning Rounds or Shock AoEs) will become "Grounded", making them unable to move until they die.
Recommended for large-caliber/sniper rounds. Not recommended against mutants.

special 	= lightning							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Ambush - If the hit target is (1) not aggro'd to/is unaware of the player and (2) the used weapon is suppressed/equipped with a silencer or a melee weapon, this causes the ammo type to jump a whole BR/AP class in most cases, and does 20% more damage.
Recommended for subsonic ammunition.

special		= ambush							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects


Explosive - Self-explanatory. Releases a explosion on contact with a surface or an enemy.
Recommended for large-calbier/sniper rounds. Reduce the k_hit and k_ap of the round to compensate (below 0.5 and 0.3 respectively).

special     = explodes							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects


"Napalm"/"Volcano" Rounds - These are hard-hitting, crowd control Incendiary Rounds. They have amazing AP values, and they afflict 8 "Burn" stacks to targets within 8 meters of the impact site.
If an enemy is the "impact site", they receive an additional 15 "Burn" stacks, meaning they will always "Ignite" upon death.
Recommended for sniper AP rounds or AP shotgun slugs.

"Burn" stacks are applied on hit, with targets receiving 3x the normal "Burn" stacks on a headshot/hitting a critical hitbox with this ammo type.
Every second, an enemy takes Fire/Burn damage equal to the number of "Burn" stacks they have. If no new "Burn" stacks are applied to a target within 5 seconds of the last application, all "Burn" stacks on the target will disappear.
If a target dies with 20 or more "Burn" stacks, they will "Ignite", spreading their "Burn" stacks evenly among an hostile targets within 8 meters of them.

special 	= napalm 							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects (not to be confused with Dragon's Breath's "fire_melt" Special tag)


Headhunter - One of the strongest effects in the game. This effect is only applied to headshots. It (1) increases the ammo's k_ap to 1.00 (max), (2) loses no damage on overpentration, and (3) negates Monolith, Sin, Zombified, and ISG resistances.
Eidelon will still put up a good fight against the round. Recommended for large-caliber/sniper rounds + make the round stupid expensive to craft and to buy.

special     = head								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects


Fragmentation - This allows the round a chance to do 30% extra damage to a target due to fragmentation on impact. Simple as.
Recommended for HP/FMJ rounds for pistols and small-caliber rifles.

special     = frag								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects
frag        = 50								-- Fragmentation chance (percent chance). Recommended range is (15-75).


RIP Rounds - These rounds heal the player for a portion of the final damage dealt after calculations.
Recommendations: (1) use for pistol HP ammo types, (2) reduce the ammo's k_hit to 0.75 or below, (3) set the k_hp in the range of (2.0 - 3.0).

mutant_mod	= 3									-- Set this between (2.0 - 3.0) as this is meant to usually be an expansive round, dealing more damage to mutants
gigant_mod  = 5									-- Set this between (3.0 - 5.0) as this is meant to usually be an expansive round, dealing more damage to mutants
special     = rip								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects


Soulripper - These rounds will heal the user for 25% of the player's total HP on each kill. Recommended on hard-hitting weapons that can be capable of regular one-shot kills.

special     = soulripper						-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects


Incendiary/API Rounds/"Burn" Rounds - These are Incendiary Armor Piercing Rounds. They have amazing AP values, and they afflict "Burn" stacks to a target based on the number assigned to it.
Recommended for rifle/sniper AP rounds.

"Burn" stacks are applied on hit, with targets receiving 3x the normal "Burn" stacks on a headshot/hitting a critical hitbox with this ammo type.
Every second, an enemy takes Fire/Burn damage equal to the number of "Burn" stacks they have. If no new "Burn" stacks are applied to a target within 5 seconds of the last application, all "Burn" stacks on the target will disappear.
If a target dies with 20 or more "Burn" stacks, they will "Ignite", spreading their "Burn" stacks evenly among an hostile targets within 8 meters of them.

special		= fire 								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects (not to be confused with Dragon's Breath's "fire_melt" Special tag)
burn_stacks	= 3									-- Amount of "Burn" stacks applied on hit. Increased by 3x upon landing headshots or hitting critical areas.


Flinch/Stun Capability - This Special is meant to help give some character to rounds that don't have an special capabilities or giving them some would break the game.
It has a chance to stun a target on hit. Mainly stuns Stalkers. Recommended to pair with "Fragmentation" or lesser ammo effect.

special     = flinch							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects
flinch      = 30								-- Flinch/stun chance (percent chance). Recommended to be set between (15-75).


Chaos/Unstable Core Rounds - These are the most interesting rounds in the game. These rounds can pull from nearly every Special Type. This round randomly does anywhere between 60 - 160% damage and AP of its base stats.
Recommended for FMJ/AP rounds due to the need for an "unstable core"

Random effects include:
	- 33.33% chance to have no Special Effect
	- 13.33% chance to Stun a target
	- 13.33% to turn into an Acid Round
	- 10% chance to turn into a Cloudkill Round
	- 6.67% chance to turn into a Lightning Round
	- 6.67% chance to inflict 4 "Burn" stacks
	- 6.67% chance to turn into a RIP Round (heal for 25% of damage dealt)
	- 3.33% chance to inflict "Basher" (AP power goes to 100 or 1.00)
	- 3.33% chance to turn into an Explosive Round
	- 3.33% chance to turn into a Graze Round

special     = chaos								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Cloudkill Rounds - These rounds are the ultimate crowd control tool. Any hostile target hit by it + any hostiles within a 5-meter radius of the struck target are debuffed. This debuff can stack indefinitely, with some limitation.
The debuff on these targets are as follows:
	- Each stack increaes the damage the debuffed target takes +20%
	- Each stack decreases the damage the debuffed target does by -15% (down to -90%/doing 10% of their base damage)

One round currently has a special exception, which is the "23x75 Eco" round - this round will one-shot-kill nearly any mutant and every Zombified Stalker (Sin not included). This is hard-coded currently.

special 	= toxic


Graze Rounds - These rounds are a new creation made by myself. Taking from the "Graze" skill from PAYDAY 2, these rounds spread the final damage against a target to surrounding targets.
Headshots/hitting critical areas will inflict 25% of the final damage to all targets. All other hits will only spread 5% of the final damage. Radius is 5m of the initial target.
For instance, if a hit's final damage is 100 and it was a headshot, all hostile targets within 5m radius will receive 25 damage. The amount of targets within the radius does not affect the damage amount dealt to targets.
Recommended for non-AP rounds as to somewhat balance the effect.

special     = graze								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects


Including a SECOND Special Ammo Type - If you wish to include a second Special effect to ammo, you will need to include the "special_2" parameter. This will allow two ammo effects to take place during damage calculations.
You must follow the rules for both Special Ammo Types and apply all the needed parameters for said effects. If both effects have an "i_particle" parameter, choose only one from either ammo type.
Below is an example of an ammo type that has both the "Incendiary/Burn" and "Shock" effects:

special 	= fire
burn_stacks	= 3
special_2 	= shock
shock_stacks = 3 


Now that we have gone through all the needed parameters, let's see a fake ammo entry for .357 HP Bad.
Fake ammo traits:
- Large-pistol caliber
- Experimental rounds (can pull from the fancy effects)
- Want to heal
- Great for mutants

[ammo_357_hp_mag_bad]:ammo_base
name 		= ammo_357_hp_mag_rip
k_hit		= 0.75
k_ap		= 0.125
k_hp		= 3
special		= rip

Now of course this won't go into effect (or can cause a crash) since that .357 HP Bad is already covered by this mod (plus this needs to be in the appropriate file), but you can follow the process to modify your own ammo types to make use of the special parts of this system.
