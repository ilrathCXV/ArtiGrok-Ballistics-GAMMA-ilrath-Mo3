Ballistics rework, merging elements of GBOOBS and ArtiBalls with new options, streamlined crafting, and new effects and effect reworks!
Started as a collaborative effort between Mo3 and ilrathCXV, fully headed by ilrathCXV with the help of other modders such as Andtheherois and etapomom.

This is currently in the BETA stage. The merge is complete and incorporated into Grok's Ballistics, while taking advantage of Arti's conversion of bad ammo to special ammo types plus some special ammo effects.

ilrathCXV - 6/30/2024 - This document is not fully up-to-date with Version 2.0.0. It is missing documentation on mutant_/gigant_/stalker_mod stats.
This will be done at a later date. Sorry for the inconvience.

Instructions for implementing new ammo/modifying ammo into ArtiGrok (written by ilrathCXV):
First, go into this mod's files and go to the directory: [this mod]\gamedata\configs\ammo
Next, either create a new .ltx (ammo_(custom_name_here).ltx without the parenthesis) or add it to the "ammo_extras_modded.ltx" file included with this mod.

We will now look at an example of an ammo type that will give you a good look at how these file entries should be structured.

Example of an ammo type that has nearly all the elements involoved in the system - 5.56x45 FMJ Bad (now bridge b/w regular FMJ and AP)

[ammo_5.56x45_fmj_bad]:ammo_5.56x45_fmj 		-- This is the debug name of the ammo. The ":ammo_5.56x45_fmj" just means it is inheriting some stats from the standard FMJ ammo. For custom ammo, I suggest using ":ammo_base"
handler     = arti_handlers.fragment_sound		-- This is a handler from Arti's system. Due to changes, the "handler" is no longer needed. But, you are free to use it in case.
name		= ammo_new_5.56x45_fmjs				-- This is the name designation of the ammo. Pull the designation from the file the ammo is found (vanilla ammo: "weapons_ammo.ltx" / BaS ammo: w_ammo_bas.ltx"). Custom ammo will be found in that mod's files.
k_hit		= 1.1 								-- This is the "k_hit" parameter of the ammo. This isn't used by the system anymore as of Update 7. This value is pulled straight from the file the ammo is found in.
k_ap		= 0.326								-- This is the "k_ap" parameter of the ammo. It has been modified from Arti's system to give players a look at the BR/AP tier an ammo type has in Grok's BR/AP system. Pull the value from ammo's file (changes in here do not change actual parameter in calculations; change it via DLTX if you want to change it).
cost        = 2250								-- This is the "cost" parameter of the ammo. It was used by Arti's system to modify the cost of ammo. Pull the value from ammo's file or change it if the ammo is old ammo you are looking to change  (changes in here only take effect is the "Cost" option in this mod's MCM settings are turned on).
dg_ammo     = ammo_5.56x45_fmj					-- This parameter takes in another ammo that this ammo can degrade/convert to when looting (in order to offset the fact bad-now-special ammo is more prevalent). Only necessary if you want to make use of this.
dg_chance   = 0.5								-- This parameter is the chance that this ammo will degrade/convert into the ammo in the above line. This MUST be used in combo with the above line if you choose to use this conversion system.
frag        = 1.6								-- Special: EXPLAINED LATER
special     = frag								-- Special: EXPLAINED LATER

There is one more parameter not shown here that does not require a Special: Expansion

k_hp		= ...

This paramter is a damage multiplier that takes effect when either (1) a mutant is hit or (2) the ammo penetrates a Stalker's armor fully (does NOT affect damage when armor is broken from repeated hits.
This "Expansion modifier" is meant to mimic certain ammo that expands on contact. I suggest keeping the value within the range of 1.15 - 1.75. Only exception is RIP ammo (explained later).


Now, to explain Special effects. I will show the Special effects, explain what they do and how to in corporate them into your ammo.
NOTE: Only one Special effect can be applied to an ammo type.

Varmaggedon - This Special type increase the damage against mutants (does no additional damage against Stalkers). Recommended range is (1.05 - 1.25), and for use with HP/hunting rounds.

handler     = arti_handlers.varmageddon			-- Not needed but can add
varma		= 1.25								-- Varmaggedon damage multiplier
special     = varma								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to see if the ammo is of this type

Dragon's Breath - Self-explanatory. This allows the ammo to act like Dragon's Breath. Receives no benefits or drawbacks due to a mutant's type. Changes hit type to Fire and has a 100% chance to ignite the enemy for 5-10 seconds.
Recommended ONLY for shotguns.

handler     = arti_handlers.dragonsbreath		-- Not needed but can add.
ignite      = 1									-- Ignite chance. MUST be set to 1 for Dragon's Breath as a pre-caution.
special     = fire_melt							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Acid Rounds - These rounds increases the amount of armor you take away from a Stalker who has a higher AP than the round's capabilities. It changes the damage type to chemical burn, and acts as a damage multiplier against mutants.

handler     = arti_handlers.acid_damage					-- Not needed but can add.
i_handler   = ballistic_handlers.particle				-- Used by Arti's system to call the particle function
i_particle  = artefact\\effects\\af_acidic_idle_color 	-- The particle effect used by the function called by the line above
special 	= acid										-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Lightning Rounds - This ammo creates an AoE damaging field when striking a target. The AoE's damage and size is increased based on the AP tier of the enemy (does not hurt the player). Highest damage possible is 70% of a Stalker's total max health.
Changes the damage type to shock damage and is a waste to use on mutants (no AoE is created from hitting mutants). Recommended for large-caliber/sniper rounds.

handler     = arti_handlers.shock_damage		-- Not needed but can add.
special 	= shock								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Ambush - If the hit target is (1) not aggro'd to/is unaware of the player and (2) the used weapon is suppressed/equipped with a silencer, this causes the ammo type to jump a whole BR/AP class in most cases, and does 20% more damage.
Recommended for subsonic ammunition.

handler     = arti_handlers.ambush				-- Not needed but can add
special		= ambush							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Explosive - Self-explanatory. Releases a explosion on contact with a surface or an enemy (can hurt the player). Recommended for large-calbier/sniper rounds. Reduce the k_hit and k_ap of the round to compensate (below 0.5 and 0.3 respectively).

impact_h    = arti_handlers.explode_handler		-- Not needed but can add
special     = explodes							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Headhunter - One of the strongest effects in the game. This effect is only applied to headshots. It (1) increases the ammo's k_ap to 1.00 (max), (2) loses no damage on overpentration, and (3) negates Sin and ISG resistances.
Eidelon will still put up a good fight against the round. Recommended for large-caliber/sniper rounds + make the round stupid expensive to craft and to buy.

handler     = arti_handlers.headshot 			-- Not needed but can add
special     = head								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Fragmentation - Similar to Expansion, this allows the round to do extra damage to a target due to fragmentation on impact. This takes effect on all hits, unlike Expansion which only affects mutants and full penetration.
NOTE: The bonus that is granted is 70% of the listed bonus. Recommended to not be used together with Expansion/k_hp (i.e. FMJ-type ammo) and a range of (1.4 - 2.0).

handler     = arti_handlers.fragment 			-- Not needed but can add
frag        = 1.5								-- Fragmentation multiplier. Multiply this 70% to see the true bonus.
special     = frag								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

RIP Rounds - These rounds heal the player for a portion of the final damage dealt after calculations.
Recommendations: (1) use for pistol HP ammo types, (2) reduce the ammo's k_hit to 0.75 or below, (3) set the k_hp in the range of (2.0 - 3.0).

handler     = arti_handlers.rip					-- Not needed but can add
k_hit		= 0.75								-- Reduce this to 0.75 or below to compensate for the healing factor
k_hp	    = 3									-- Set this between (2.0 - 3.0) as this round is meant to exapnd much more than standard HP ammo
special     = rip								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Soulripper - These rounds are idential to RIP Rounds, but only heal on headshots and are meant for AP rounds rather than HP rounds. Recommended for hard-hitting sniper rounds.

handler     = arti_handlers.soulripper			-- Not needed but can add
special     = soulripper						-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Incendiary/API Rounds - These are Incendiary Armor Piercing Rounds. They have amazing AP values with a chance to ignite an enemy on hit. However, this round does NOT change the damage type to fire.
Recommended for rifle/sniper AP rounds.

handler     = arti_handlers.fire_damage			-- Not needed but can add
ignite      = 0.6								-- Ignite chance. Recommended to be set between (0.3 - 0.75).
special		= fire 								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects (not to be confused with Dragon's Breath's "fire_melt" Special tag)

Flinch/Stun Capability - This Special is meant to help give some character to rounds that don't have an special capabilities or giving them some would break the game. It has a chance to stun a target on hit.

flinch      = 0.5								-- Flinch/stun chance. Recommended to be set between (0.5 - 0.95).
special     = flinch							-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects

Chaos/Unstable Core Rounds - These are the most interesting rounds in the game. These rounds can pull from nearly every Special Type. This round randomly does anywhere between 60 - 160% damage and AP of its base stats.
Random effects include (all at a 6.67% chance to occur): Dragon's Breath (5sec), Stun, RIP Heal, Headhunter's maxed out AP (does not ignore Sin/ISG Resistances), Acid, Explosive
Random chance for no effect: 60%
Recommended for FMJ/AP rounds due to the need for an "unstable core"

handler     = arti_handlers.chaos_damage		-- Not needed but can add
special     = chaos								-- Special tag needed by the damage system to make use of this ammo's special effects


Now that we have gone through all the needed parameters, let's see a fake ammo entry for .357 HP Bad.
Fake ammo traits:
- Large-pistol caliber
- Experimental rounds (can pull from the fancy effects)
- Want to heal
- Great for mutants
- Must be expensive due to its nature

[ammo_357_hp_mag_bad]:ammo_base					-- can use :ammo_357_hp_mag as well
name 		= ammo_357_hp_mag_rip
k_hit		= 0.75
k_ap		= 0.125
k_hp		= 3
cost		= 6500
special		= rip

Now of course this won't go into effect (or can cause a crash) since that .357 HP Bad is already covered by this mod, but you can follow the process to modify your own ammo types to make use of the special parts of this system.
