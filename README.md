# ArtiGrok Ballistics for GAMMA - Merge of Arti's Ballisitcs and GAMMA Close Quarters Combat

This mod is an ongoing project to merge the Special Ammo effects from "Arti's Ballistics" - in addition to some effects created by myself - with the damage system of GAMMA. This extensive mod allows for more unique and fun playstyles for various different calibers.

**Mod Features:**
- Revamping of old ammo into new ammo with special or anomalous effects
- Utilizes Grok's Ballistic System for GAMMA with Arti's special anomalous effects
- Artefact Fragments are new crafting components needed to craft special ammo - found from **killing poltergeists** or **crushing artefacts**
- Ammo icons made by **Andtheherois - ATHI** and myself
- Ammo will now have their stats and effects displayed in their tooltips (credit to Momopate and Arti)
- MCM options to ignore difficulty reducing player damage/AP, use realistic damage drop-off calculations, and allowing NPCs to follow the same damage outgoing damage calculations as the player
- Basic Mags Support
- Includes **Momopate's ** "20x70 Slugs" and ".45 AP Behemoth" mods
- Includes my "9x21 HP + FMJ" and ".357 FMJ Monolithic" mods

Additionally includes partial support for most other custom-made ammo types (this mod does not act as a substitute for these mods):
- ATHI's [SIG SPEAR 6.8 Fury](https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1036112180145299536)
- Retro's [.300 Blackout + .458 SOCOM Weapon pack](https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1036727845726204024)
- 30-06, .45-70 Gov., 30-30, and .44 Mag in Shon's ["Western Wonders"](https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1055545995330592848)
- Mr.B's [10mm Auto Ecosystem]([https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1114443301349757088](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/mrbs-10mm-auto-ecosystem))

**Install Instructions:** (updated as of July 3, 2024)
- Download this mod from the link above
- Download Momopate's "Actual Accurate Stats" mod found in the [GAMMA Discord](https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1161433800803360808)
- Install both mods through MO2
- ArtiGrok should be loaded _**LAST**_ in your load order, with "Actual Accurate Stats" loaded *before* ArtiGrok
- Disable `Slugler's & Andtheherois's No old ammo in wheel` (in MO2's **G.A.M.M.A. Fixes**)
- In MCM, go to "Actual Accurate Stats", then disable any options regarding ammo stats to ensure the ammo tooltip works correctly
- [_**pre-2.0.4**_] In MCM, go to "Item UI Improvements" and turn on "Ammo Names"

**If you cannot see the ammo stats in the tooltips, read the below:**
- If you use the mod "Ghillie Suit Overhaul", here is a patch in the GAMMA Discord (read the surrounding posts of this link to see how to install it): https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1106795093513478215/1128885711379103805
- If your stats show a bunch of negatives and some weapons now have damage in the hundreds that shouldn't **you forgot to install Actual Accurate Stats**
- If you receive a crash regarding `fourth_times_counter` and **using [RPG Perks](https://github.com/ilrathCXV/RPG-XP-Redux-Orleon-ilrathCXV)**, install the latest version of the RPG mod (Update 31+)

**Things to Note:**
- Safe to install mid-playthrough, **UNSAFE to uninstall mid-playthrough**
- Always look at tooltip stats for info
- Any mod not native to GAMMA that modifies the `grok_bo.script` will not be compatible as this mod disables that script
- **If you use "Revised Ammo Maker", DISABLE the mod to prevent crashes.**

Any bug reports are to be reported here. **DO NOT REPORT BUGS TO THE AUTHORS OF THE MODS MENTIONED HERE.** Open to suggestions regarding balance.

**Credits:**
- Grok for GBOOBS and GAMMA
- Arti + HarukaMaid for Arti's Ballistics system
- Momopate for his ammo mods, Actual Accurate Stats, and his bullet drop-off function 
- ATHI (Andtheherois) for creating the revamped icons for this mod
